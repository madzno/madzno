# Hi there 👋, I'm Maddy! 

I'm a Software Engineer based in New York, NY 🏙 currently on the Backend Engineering team at myfitnesspal. I love to learn 👩‍💻, especially about new backend technologies and system architecture.

### 🚀 Twine Real-Time 

I created [Twine](https://twine-realtime.github.io/) which is an open-source drop-in auto-scaling WebSocket infrastructure for modern web applications that provides 
connection state recovery. Twine drops into an existing application via client and server libraries and is automatically deployed into a user's AWS
account.
