# Hi there 👋, I'm Maddy!

I'm a lifelong learner who enjoys ramping up on new technologies and tools 👩‍💻.

### 🚀 Twine Real-Time 

Recently I created [Twine](https://twine-realtime.github.io/) a drop-in auto-scaling WebSocket infrastructure for modern web applications that provides 
connection state recovery. Twine drops into an existing application via client and server libraries and is automatically deployed into a user's AWS
account.
